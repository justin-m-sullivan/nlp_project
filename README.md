## Predicting Programming Language in Github Repos Using NLP and Classification


### Project Goal
To build a classification model that more accurately predicts the primary programming language used in a github's repo based of the repo's readme contents. 

### Key Takeaways
The KNN model can assist Github users in filtering and identifying relevant repos by correctly predicting the primary programming language used 3 out of 4 times. That is an improvement of 36 percentage points over the baseline model.

### Data Dictionary
